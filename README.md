# Dynamatic
Dynamatic is an academic, open-source high-level synthesis compiler that produces synchronous dynamically-scheduled circuits from C/C++ code. Dynamatic generates synthesizable RTL which currently targets Xilinx FPGAs and delivers significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art commercial HLS tools in specific situations (e.g., applications with irregular memory accesses or control-dominated code). The fully automated compilation flow of Dynamatic is based on MLIR. It is customizable and extensible to target different hardware platforms and easy to use with commercial tools such as Vivado (Xilinx) and Modelsim (Mentor Graphics).

## Performance
Dynamatic translates C/C++ code into high performance dataflow circuits implemented in VHDL or Verilog based on the user's needs. Dynamatic typically has a better or similar performance to state-of-the-art HLS tools like Vitis HLS in the area of dataflow circuits. Dynamatic also yields a better performance for an acceptable increase in physical resources used. Different flags are available to allow the user to optimize the circuits generated by Dynamatic to suit their specific needs.

## Dependencies
Dynamatic uses 
- [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to manage its software dependencies (all hosted on GitHub). 
- [Polygeist](https://github.com/llvm/Polygeist), a C/C++ frontend for MLIR which itself depends on [LLVM/MLIR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) through a git submodule. The project is set up so that you can include LLVM/MLIR headers directly from Dynamatic code without having to specify their path through Polygeist. 
- [godot-cpp](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp), the official C++ bindings for the Godot game engine which we use as the frontend to our interactive dataflow circuit visualizer.
- [Modelsim](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/750368/modelsim-intel-fpgas-standard-edition-software-version-18-1.html)/[Questa](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/849791/questa-intel-fpgas-standard-edition-software-version-24-1.html) for our simulation tool. See [installation](docs/UserGuide/AdvancedBuild.md) page on how to setup Modelsim/Questa.
- [CIRCT](https://github.com/EPFL-LAP/circt) project (details [below](#circt)) from which we inherit two MLIR dialects (Handshake and HW)
- [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) to solve performance-related optimization problems. Dynamatic is still functional without Gurobi, but the resulting circuits often fail to achieve acceptable performance. See how to set up gurobi in the [advanced build section](docs/UserGuide/AdvancedBuild.md)
