# Introduction to Dynamatic

This tutorial is divided in the following two chapters.

- [Chapter #1 - Using Dynamatic](UsingDynamatic.md) | We use Dynamatic's frontend to synthesize our first dataflow circuit from C code, then visualize it using our interactive dataflow visualizer. 
- [Chapter #2 - Modifying Dynamatic](ModifyingDynamatic.md) | We write a small compiler transformation pass in C++ to try to improve circuit performance and decrease area, then debug it using the visualizer.
