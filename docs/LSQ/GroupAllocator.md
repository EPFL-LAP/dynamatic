# Group Allocator

How groups are allocated to LSQ in the dataflow circuit.



## 1.â€‚Overview and Purpose  

![Group Allocator Top-Level](./figs/ga/LSQ_Top-Level_group_allocator.png)

The Group Allocator is a module that manages entry allocation for the Load-Store Queue (LSQ). It operates using a method called Group Allocation.

A group is defined as a sequence of memory accesses that cannot be interrupted by a control flow decision (for example, all memory operations within a single basic block).

Instead of allocating one LSQ entry at a time for each memory operation, the Group Allocator reserves entries for all operations belonging to a group at once. This bulk allocation occurs when an accelerator activates a specific group.

### Interface Signals

The constants used in the 'Dimensionality' column of the table below are derived from the generator configuration and are defined as follows:

* `N_GROUPS`: The total number of memory access groups.
* `N_LDQ_ENTRIES`: The total number of entries in the Load Queue.
* `N_STQ_ENTRIES`: The total number of entries in the Store Queue.
* `LDQ_ADDR_WIDTH`: The bit-width required to index an entry in the Load Queue.
* `STQ_ADDR_WIDTH`: The bit-width required to index an entry in the Store Queue.
* `LDP_ADDR_WIDTH`: The bit-width required to index the source/destination port for a load operation.
* `STP_ADDR_WIDTH`: The bit-width required to index the source/destination port for a store operation.

In the VHDL Signal Name column, the following placeholders are used: `{g}` for the group index, `{le}` for the Load Queue entry index, and `{se}` for the Store Queue entry index.

The Group Allocator has the following responsibilities:

1. **Queue Space Calculator**  
![Occupied Entry Calculation Description](./figs/ga/GA_1_Queue_Space_Calculator.png)  
![Occupied Entry Calculation](./figs/ga/GA_1.png)  
    This block performs an initial calculation of the number of occupied entries in each queue.  
    - **Input**:  
        - `ldq_head_i`, `ldq_tail_i`: Head and tail pointers for the Load Queue.
        - `stq_head_i`, `stq_tail_i`: Head and tail pointers for the Store Queue.  
    - **Processing**:  
        - It performs a cyclic subtraction (`WrapSub`) of the pointers for each queue. This calculation gives the number of empty slots but is ambiguous when the two pointers are the same (`head == tail`) since it can either mean empty or full.  

              WrapSub

                if head >= tail:
                    out = head - tail
                else:
                    out = (head + numEntries) - tail
    - **Output**:  
        - `loads_sub`, `stores_sub`: Intermediate signals holding the result of the cyclic subtraction for each queue.


2. **Free Entry Calculation**  
![Free Entry Calculation Description](./figs/ga/GA_2_Free_Entry_Calculation.png)  
![Free Entry Calculation](./figs/ga/GA_2.png)  
    This block determines the final number of free entries available in each queue.
    - **Input**:
        - `loads_sub`, `stores_sub`: The tentative free entry counts from the previous block.
        - `ldq_empty_i`, `stq_empty_i`: Flags indicating if each queue is empty.
    - **Processing**:
        - It uses multiplexer logic to resolve the ambiguity of the previous step.
        - If a queue's `empty` flag is asserted, it outputs the maximum queue size (`numLdqEntries` or `numStqEntries`).
        - Otherwise, it outputs the result from the `WrapSub` calculation.
    - **Output**:
        - `empty_loads`, `empty_stores`: The definitive number of free entries in the load and store queues.

3. **Ready Signal Generation**  
![Ready Signal Generation Description](./figs/ga/GA_3_Ready_Signal_Generation.png)  
![Ready Signal Generation](./figs/ga/GA_3.png)  
    This block checks if there is sufficient space in the queues for each potential group.
    - **Input**:
        - `empty_loads`, `empty_stores`: The number of free entries available in each queue.
        - `gaNumLoads`, `gaNumStores`: Configuration arrays specifying the number of loads and stores required by each group.
    - **Processing**:
        - For each group, it compares the available space (`empty_loads`, `empty_stores`) with the required space (`gaNumLoads[g]`, `gaNumStores[g]`).
        - A group is considered "ready" only if there is enough space for *both* its loads and its stores.
    - **Output**:
        - `group_init_ready`: An array of ready signals, one for each group, indicating whether it could be allocated.
        - `group_init_ready_o`: The final ready signals sent to the external logic.


4. **Handshake and Arbitration**  
![Handshake and Arbitration Description](./figs/ga/GA_4_Handshake_and_Arbitration.png)  
![Handshake and Arbitration](./figs/ga/GA_4.png)  
    This block performs the final handshake to select a single oldest group for the current cycle. However, the arbitration happens when one of the configuration signal `gaMulti` is on, and this diagram depicts when `gaMulti` is off.  
    - **Input**:
        - `group_init_ready`: The readiness status for each group from the previous block.
        - `group_init_valid_i`: The external valid signals for each group.
        - (Optional) `ga_rr_mask`: A round-robin mask used for arbitration if multiple groups can be allocated (`gaMulti` is true).
    - **Processing**:
        - It combines the `ready` and `valid` signals. A group must be both ready and valid to be a candidate for allocation.
        - If multiple groups are candidates, an arbitrator (e.g., `CyclicPriorityMasking`) selects a single group. If `gaMulti` is false, it assumes only one valid allocation request can occur at a time as depicted.
    - **Output**:
        - `group_init_hs`: A one-hot signal indicating the single group that will be allocated at the current cycle.



5. **Port Index Generation**  
![Port Index Generation Description](./figs/ga/GA_5_Port_Index_Generator.png)  
![Port Index Generation](./figs/ga/GA_5.png)  
    This block generates the correctly aligned port indices for the entries being allocated.
    - **Input**:
        - `group_init_hs`: A one-hot signal indicating the single group that will be allocated at the current cycle.
        - `ldq_tail_i`, `stq_tail_i`: The current tail pointers of the queues.
        - `gaLdPortIdx`, `gaStPortIdx`: Pre-compiled ROMs containing the port indices for each group.
    - **Processing**:
        - Uses the `group_init_hs` signal to perform a ROM lookup (`Mux1HROM`), selecting the list of port indices for the allocated group.
        - Performs `CyclicLeftShift` on the selected list, using the corresponding queue's `tail` pointer as the shift amount. This aligns the indices to the correct physical queue entry slots.
    - **Output**:
        - `ldq_port_idx_o`, `stq_port_idx_o`: The final, shifted port indices to be written into the newly allocated queue entries.


6. **Order Matrix Generation**  
![Order Matrix Generation Description](./figs/ga/GA_6_Order_Matrix_Generation.png)  
![Order Matrix Generation](./figs/ga/GA_6.png)  
    This block generates the load-store order matrix between the new loads and stores in the allocated group.
    - **Input**:
        - `group_init_hs`: A one-hot signal indicating the single group that will be allocated at the current cycle.
        - `ldq_tail_i`, `stq_tail_i`: The current tail pointers of the queues.
        - `gaLdOrder`: A pre-compiled ROM containing the load-store order information for each group. For each group, the corresponding list indicates, from the perspective of a load, the number of stores that come before it within the same group.
    - **Processing**:
        - Uses `group_init_hs` to perform a ROM lookup, selecting the order information for the allocated group. This information is used to build an un-aligned load-store order matrix.
        - A `1` in `(le, se)` indicates that `store_{se}` comes before `load_{le}`. This is built by the function `MaskLess`.
        - Performs `CyclicLeftShift` on this matrix two times, shifting it horizontally by `stq_tail_i` and vertically by `ldq_tail_i`. This correctly places the sub-matrix within the LSQ's main order matrix.
    - **Output**:
        - `ga_ls_order_o`: The final, shifted load-store order matrix defining order of the new loads and stores.

7. **Load/Store Count Extraction**  
![Load/Store Count Extraction Description](./figs/ga/GA_7_Load_Store_Count_Extraction.png)  
![Load/Store Count Extraction](./figs/ga/GA_7.png)  
    This block extracts the number of loads and stores for the allocated group.
    - **Input**:
        - `group_init_hs`: A one-hot signal indicating the single group that will be allocated at the current cycle.
        - `gaNumLoads`, `gaNumStores`: Pre-compiled ROMs containing the load/store counts for each group.
    - **Processing**:
        - Performs a simple ROM lookup (`Mux1HROM`) using `group_init_hs` to select the number of loads and stores corresponding to the allocated group.

![Write Enable Generation Description](./figs/ga/GA_8_Write_Enable_Generation.png)  
![Write Enable Generation](./figs/ga/GA_8.png)  
    This final block generates the write-enable signals to allocate the new queue entries.
    - **Input**:
        - `num_loads`, `num_stores`: The load/store counts from the previous block.
        - `ldq_tail_i`, `stq_tail_i`: The current tail pointers of the queues.
    - **Processing**:
        - First, it creates an unshifted bitmask. For example, if `num_loads` is 3, the mask is `...00111`.
        - It then applies `CyclicLeftShift` to this mask, using the queue's `tail` pointer as the shift amount. This rotates the block of `1`s to start at the `tail` position.
    - **Output**:
        - `ldq_wen_o`, `stq_wen_o`: The final write-enable vectors, which assert a '1' for the precise entries in each queue that are being allocated.


## 3.â€‚Dataflow Walkthrough


![Group Allocator](./figs/ga/group_allocator_example.png)

This walkthrough explains the step-by-step operation of the `Group Allocator` based on the following precise initial state:
![Initial State](./figs/ga/GA_0.png)  

* **Queue State**:
    * Load Queue: `ldq_tail`=1, `ldq_head`=4, `ldq_empty_i`=0 (Not Empty)
    * Store Queue: `stq_tail`=1, `stq_head`=1, `stq_empty_i`=1 (Empty)
* **Queue Sizes**: `numLdqEntries`=6, `numStqEntries`=4
* **Group Allocation Request**: `group_init_valid_i`=`[1,0,0,0,0]` (Only Group 0 is requesting for the allocation)
* **Group Configurations**:
    * `gaNumLoads` = `[3, 2, 1, 6, 3]`
    * `gaNumStores` = `[2, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

---

#### 1. Occupied Entry Calculation
![Occupied Entry Calculation](./figs/ga/GA_1.png)  
This block calculates the number of currently free entries in each queue.

* **Load Queue**: It performs a cyclic subtraction `ldq_head`(4) - `ldq_tail`(1) = `3`. There are **3** free entries.
* **Store Queue**: It performs a cyclic subtraction `stq_head`(1) - `stq_tail`(1) = `0`. We cannot say that there are **0** free entries. 

#### 2. Free Entry Calculation
![Free Entry Calculation](./figs/ga/GA_2.png)  
This block calculates the number of available empty entries.

* **Load Queue**: Since `ldq_empty_i` is `0` (false), there are **3** free entries in the load queue.
* **Store Queue**: Since `stq_empty_i` is `1` (true), it outputs the total queue size. There are **4** free entries in the Store Queue.

#### 3. Ready Signal Generation
![Ready Signal Generation](./figs/ga/GA_3.png)  
This block checks if the load queue and store queue are ready to be allocated.

* **Required Space for Group 0**: `gaNumLoads[0]`=3, `gaNumStores[0]`=2.
  * **Comparison**:
      * Loads: Is free space (3) >= required space (3)? **Yes**.
      * Stores: Is free space (4) >= required space (2)? **Yes**.
      * `group_init_ready[0] = 1`
* **Required Space for Group 1**: `gaNumLoads[1]`=2, `gaNumStores[1]`=1.
  * **Comparison**:
      * Loads: Is free space (3) >= required space (2)? **Yes**.
      * Stores: Is free space (4) >= required space (1)? **Yes**.
      * `group_init_ready[1] = 1`
* **Required Space for Group 2**: `gaNumLoads[2]`=1, `gaNumStores[2]`=2.
  * **Comparison**:
      * Loads: Is free space (3) >= required space (1)? **Yes**.
      * Stores: Is free space (4) >= required space (2)? **Yes**.
      * `group_init_ready[2] = 1`
* **Required Space for Group 3**: `gaNumLoads[3]`=6, `gaNumStores[3]`=3.
  * **Comparison**:
      * Loads: Is free space (3) >= required space (6)? **No**.
      * Stores: Is free space (4) >= required space (3)? **Yes**.
      * `group_init_ready[3] = 0`
* **Required Space for Group 4**: `gaNumLoads[4]`=3, `gaNumStores[4]`=4.
  * **Comparison**:
      * Loads: Is free space (3) >= required space (3)? **Yes**.
      * Stores: Is free space (4) >= required space (4)? **Yes**.
      * `group_init_ready[4] = 1`


#### 4. Handshake and Arbitration
![Handshake and Arbitration](./figs/ga/GA_4.png)  
This block performs the handshake to select a "winning" group.

* The incoming request `group_init_valid_i` is `[1,0,0,0,0]`.
* The `ready` signal for Group 0 is `1`.
* The AND result is `[1,0,0,0,0]`, and since only one request is active, the arbitrator selects **Group 0** as the winner.

#### 5. Port Index Generation
![Port Index Generation](./figs/ga/GA_5.png)  
This block generates the correctly aligned port indices for the newly allocated entries. It first looks up the data for the winning group (Group 0), pads it to the full queue length, and then performs the specified shift operation to align it with the `tail` pointer.

* **Load Port Index (`ldq_port_idx_o`):**
    1.  **ROM Lookup & Padding:** It fetches `gaLdPortIdx[0]`, which is `[0, 1, 2]`. This means that `load0_0` (Group0's 0th load), `load0_1` (Group0's 1st load), and `load0_2` (Group0's 2nd load) use `Port 0`, `Port 1`, and `Port 2` respectively. Since the load queue has 6 entries, this is padded to create the intermediate vector `ldq_port_idx_rom = [0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0]`.
    2.  **CyclicLeftShift:** This `[0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0]` vector is then cyclically shifted left by the `ldq_tail` value, which is `1`. This means the first element (`0`) moves to the end, and all other elements shift left, resulting in **`[0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0]`**.
    3. **Final Matrix Output (6x4)**: This result is converted into the final 6x4 matrix (`ldpAddrW=4`), where each number represents a 2-bit port index:

      ldq_port_idx_o =
      [
        "0000", // Physical Entry 0
        "0000", // Physical Entry 1
        "0001", // Physical Entry 2
        "0010", // Physical Entry 3
        "0000", // Physical Entry 4
        "0000"  // Physical Entry 5
      ]

* **Store Port Index (`stq_port_idx_o`):**
    1.  **ROM Lookup & Padding:** It fetches `gaStPortIdx[0]`, which is `[0, 1]`. This is padded to the 4-entry store queue length to become `[0, 1, 0, 0]`.
    2.  **Cyclic Left Shift:** This `[0, 1, 0, 0]` vector is shifted left by the `stq_tail` value (`1`), resulting in **`[0, 0, 1, 0]`**.
    3. **Final Matrix Output (4x4)**: This is converted into the final 4x4 matrix:

      stq_port_idx_o =
      [
        "0000", // Physical Entry 0
        "0000", // Physical Entry 1
        "0001", // Physical Entry 2
        "0000"  // Physical Entry 3
      ]


#### 6. Order Matrix Generation
![Order Matrix Generation](./figs/ga/GA_6.png)  
This block fetches the intra-group order matrix for Group 0 and aligns it.

* **ROM Lookup**: It retrieves `gaLdOrder[0]`, which is `[0, 0, 2]`. This means the following:
    * `load0_0`: There are `0` stores before `load0_0`
    * `load0_1`: There are `0` stores before `load0_1`
    * `load0_2`: There are `2` stores before `load0_2`

  For this, the order matrix becomes 

            ga_ls_order_rom
                                    SQ0 SQ1 SQ2 SQ3
            Load Queue Entry 0:    [ 0,  0,  0,  0 ]
            Load Queue Entry 1:    [ 0,  0,  0,  0 ]
            Load Queue Entry 2:    [ 1,  1,  0,  0 ]
            Load Queue Entry 3:    [ 0,  0,  0,  0 ]
            Load Queue Entry 4:    [ 0,  0,  0,  0 ]
            Load Queue Entry 5:    [ 0,  0,  0,  0 ]
            

     
* **2D Cyclic Left Shift**: This data is shifted based on `ldq_tail` (1) and `stq_tail` (1) to correctly place it within the LSQ's main order matrix.

            ga_ls_order_o
                                    SQ0 SQ1 SQ2 SQ3
            Load Queue Entry 0:    [ 0,  0,  0,  0 ]
            Load Queue Entry 1:    [ 0,  0,  0,  0 ]
            Load Queue Entry 2:    [ 0,  0,  0,  0 ]
            Load Queue Entry 3:    [ 0,  1,  1,  0 ]
            Load Queue Entry 4:    [ 0,  0,  0,  0 ]
            Load Queue Entry 5:    [ 0,  0,  0,  0 ]


#### 7. Load/Store Count Extraction
![Load/Store Count Extraction](./figs/ga/GA_7.png)  
This block extracts the number of loads and stores for the winning group (Group 0).

* **ROM Lookup**: It retrieves `gaNumLoads[0]` (`3`) and `gaNumStores[0]` (`2`).
* The outputs `num_loads_o` and `num_stores_o` become `3` and `2`, respectively.

#### 8. Write Enable Generation
![Write Enable Generation](./figs/ga/GA_8.png)  
This final block generates the write-enable pulses that activate the newly allocated queue entries.

* **Unshifted Mask Creation**:
    * Loads: `num_loads` (`3`) creates a 6-bit unshifted mask `000111`.
    * Stores: `num_stores` (`2`) creates a 4-bit unshifted mask `0011`.
* **Cyclic Left Shift**:
    * `ldq_wen_o`: The mask `000111` is shifted by `ldq_tail` (`1`), resulting in `001110`.
    * `stq_wen_o`: The mask `0011` is shifted by `stq_tail` (`1`), resulting in `0110`.
* These final vectors assert '1' for entries 1, 2, 3 in the Load Queue and entries 1, 2 in the Store Queue, activating them for the new group.
