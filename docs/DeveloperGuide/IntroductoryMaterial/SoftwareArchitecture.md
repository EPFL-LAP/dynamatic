# Software architecture

This section provides an overview of the software architecture of the project and is meant as an entry-point for users who would like to start digging into the codebase. It describes the project's directory structure, our software dependencies (i.e., git submodules), and our testing infrastructure.

## Directory structure

This section is intended to give an overview of the project's directory structure and an idea of what each directory contains to help new users more easily look for and find specific parts of the implementation. Note that the superproject is structured very similarly to LLVM/MLIR, thus this overview is useful for navigating this repository as well. For exploring/editing the codebase, we strongly encourage the use of an IDE with a *go to reference/implementation* feature (e.g., *VSCode*) to easily navigate between header/source files. Below is a visual representation of a subset of the project's directory structure, with basic information on what each directory contains.

```sh
├── bin # Symbolic links to commonly used binaries after build (untracked)
├── build # Files generated during build (untracked)
│   └── bin # Binaries generated by the superproject
│       └── include
│           └── dynamatic # Compiled TableGen headers (*.h.inc)
├── docs # Documentation and tutorials, where this file lies
├── experimental # Experimental passes and tools
├── include
│   ├── dynamatic # All header files (*.h)
├── integration-test # Integration tests
├── lib # Implementation of compiler passes (*.cpp)
│   ├── Conversion # Implementation of conversion passes (*.cpp)
│   └── Transforms # Implementation of transform passes (*.cpp)
├── polygeist # Polygeist repository (submodule)
│   └── llvm-project # LLVM/MLIR repository (submodule)
├── test # Unit tests
