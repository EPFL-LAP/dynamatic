# elastic-miter
### A tool to compare two MLIR circuits in the Handshake dialect


The tool compares two MLIR circuits in the handshake dialect by constructing an Elastic-Miter circuit, formally verfiying their (non-)equivalence. (TODO citation to paper).


### Usage
By default the tool uses NuSMV for the verification. The official version on supports printing 2^16 state spaces. To circumvent this problem a modified binary supporting 2^24 states can be downloaded using CMake.
Make sure to use the `--enable-leq-binaries` flag when using `build.sh`


Currently, the conversion to SMV requires the dot2smv converter. It is also downloaded when using the  `--enable-leq-binaries` flag.


The tool supports following options:
```bash
elastic-miter --lhs=<lhs-file-path> --rhs=<lhs-file-path> -o <out-dir> [--loop=<string>] [--loop_strict=<string>] [--seq_length=<string>] [--token_limit=<string>] [--cex]
```


#### Command-line options

```bash
--lhs=<string>          Specify the left-hand side (LHS) input file
--rhs=<string>          Specify the right-hand side (RHS) input file
-o <string>             Specify the output directory
--loop=<string>         Specify a Loop Condition sequence contraint. Can be used multiple times.
--loop_strict=<string>  Specify a Strict Loop Condition sequence contraint. Can be used multiple times.
--seq_length=<string>   Specify a Sequence Length Relation constraint. Can be used multiple times.
--token_limit=<string>  Specify a Token Limit constraint. Can be used multiple times.
--cex                   Enable counterexamples.
```


#### Sequence constraints

Since the compared circuits are usually part of a larger circuit, they do not need to be equivalent under all circumstances, but rather only under specific *contexts*. These context are modeled using constraints on the sequence generators. 


##### Sequence Length Relation
A Sequence Length Relation constraint controls the relative length of the input sequences.
The constraint has the form of an arithmetic equation. The number in the equation will be replaced the respective input with the index of the number.  
Example:  
`--seq_length="0+1=2"` will ensure that the inputs with index 0 and index 1 together produce as many tokens as the input with index 2.


##### Loop Condition
A Loop Condition sequence contraint has the form "<dataSequence>,<controlSequence>".
The number of tokens in the input with the index dataSequence is equivalent to the number of false tokens at the output with the index controlSequence.  
Example:  
`--loop="0,1"`

##### Token Limit
A Token Limit constraint has the form "<inputSequence>,<outputSequence>,<limit>".
At any point in time, the number of tokens which are created at the input with index inputSequence can only be up to "limit" higher than the number of tokens reaching the output with the index outputSequence.  
Example:  
`--token_limit="1,1,2"` ensures that there are only two tokens in the circuit which enter at the input with index 1 and leave at the ouput with index 1.

#### Examples

Some rewrites, with which the tool can be tested, are provided. Additionally, the `prove-rewrites.sh` script runs all tests.

```bash
experimental/tools/elastic-miter/prove-rewrites.sh
```

To directly call the tool a command like this can be used:
```bash
OUT_DIR="experimental/tools/elastic-miter/out"
REWRITES="experimental/test/tools/elastic-miter/rewrites"
elastic-miter --lhs=$REWRITES/b_lhs.mlir --rhs=$REWRITES/b_rhs.mlir -o $OUT_DIR --seq_length="0+1=3" --seq_length="0=2" --loop_strict=0,1
```
