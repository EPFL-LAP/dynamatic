    This pass goes through all operations inside handshake::FuncOps that do not
    have a 'bb' attribute and tries to infer its value based on the operation's
    dataflow predecessors. When the pass's heuristic manages to infer the value,
    the 'bb' attribute is added to the operation. This pass never fails, even

    delete the original operation if it not used within its defining block.
