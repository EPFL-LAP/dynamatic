//===- HandshakeSetBufferingProperties.h - Set buf. props. ------*- C++ -*-===//
//
// This file declares the --handshake-set-buffering-properties pass, which is
// useful to run before the buffer placement pass to make sure that all buffer
// placement constraints that can be deduced from the IR structure alone are
// part of the IR.
//
// It is possible, and certrainly necessary in some cases, to have other
// transformation passes tag the channels they care about with specific
// buffering properties as they go. However, there is a risk that these
// properties won't be fully honored in the intended way if further
// transformation passes alter tagged channel before buffer placement. While
// passes should do their best to preserve those properties when transforming
// the IR, some cases are likely to fall through or to be difficult to handle.
// This pass can serve as a "last transformation" before buffer placement and
// allow one to be sure that buffering properties set here are honored in the
// exact intended way.
