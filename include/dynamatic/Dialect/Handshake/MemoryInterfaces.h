/// access with an equivalent one from a "lower-level" dialect while keeping the
/// memory-related attributes (interface and dependence information)
/// semantically equivalent. However, each `handshake::MemoryDependenceAttr`
/// attribute refers to the memory access with which the dependency exists via
/// its unique name, which becomes incorrect when the referenced access changes
/// name after its associated operation is lowered. The class provides an easy
/// way to record such memory access replacements and rename any reference to
/// them in memory dependence annotations across the IR.
