# Espresso

The original Espresso code comes from the [1989 Berkeley code](https://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/pubs/downloads/espresso/index.htm). See the COPYING file for original code license.

This distribution is just a C99 port of the [excellent work made by Andrew to simplify and port to C89 standards](https://github.com/Rupan/espresso/tree/master/jni/espresso).
