//
// In particular, this file offers ways to interact with the concept of "logical
// basic blocks" in Handshake functions. These are not basic blocks in the MLIR
// sense since Handshake function only have a single block. They instead map to
// the original basic blocks that the cf-level IR possessed before conversion to
// Handshake-level. Any Handshake operation may optionally have a "bb" integer
// attribute indicating the basic block it logically belonged to at the
// cf-level.
