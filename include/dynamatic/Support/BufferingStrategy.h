//===- BufferingStrategy.h - Buffer placement strategy ----------*- C++ -*-===//
//
// Infrastructure for specifying and manipulating buffering strategies, which
// are used by the buffer placement logic to constrain the nature and
// positions of buffers in elastic circuits.
//
// NOTE: The underlying attribute that stores buffering properties for an
// operation's results internally uses the index of each operation's result to
// track which properties belong to which result. Modifying the list of results
// after having added channel buffering properties will therefore break this
// mapping and lead to undefined behavior.
