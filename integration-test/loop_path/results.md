# Results `loop_path` (Code and CFG modified)

The speculation case achieved an II of 1, matching the results in Haoran's thesis.

The II is only 2, even in the non-speculation case. This is because the break condition `(1000 - temp) <= x * temp` is optimized in the current frontend, eliminating the multiplication.
